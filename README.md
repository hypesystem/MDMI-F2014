**Mining a Million Songs for Obvious Reasons and Profit.**

Questions
---------

Recommend songs based on the structure of the songs (unlike usual recommendation systems that are based on *what other users do*).

**Corollary:** Look at song lyrics, in addition to structure of songs.

The questions are in prioritized order. The idea is to start at the top and complete as many as possible.

1. Given a song, recommend songs that are *similar in structure*.
2. Given a user, recommend songs *similar in structure* those the user listens to.
3. Given a new song, estimate the *hotness* it will achieve once released.
