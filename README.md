Questions
---------

The questions are in prioritized order. The idea is to start at the top and complete as many as possible.

1. Given a song, recommend songs that are *similar in structure*.
2. Given a user, recommend songs *similar in structure* those the user listens to.
3. Given a new song, estimate the *hotness* it will achieve once released.
