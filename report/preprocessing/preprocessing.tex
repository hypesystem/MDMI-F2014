The Million Song Dataset is provided in the HDF5 format, a format renowned for its extendability. HDF5
allows data formats to be designed specifically for data. \citep{hdfgrp} For the song data, only fairly straight-forward data
structures are used, but the amount of data is huge.
\\\\
We are using Data Bionics ESOM Analyzer (ESOM) to analyze the data. ESOM uses a tab-separated data format called LRN. The full HDF5 dataset contains too much data to be handled by any data mining algorithms. As such, we need to both select the relevant data and convert it to the correct file format.
