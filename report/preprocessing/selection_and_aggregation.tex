\subsection{Selection and Aggregation}
\label{sec:preprocessing_selection}
The objective of this project was to generate lists of songs, where each song in the list is similar to the preceding one in dynamic, harmonic and spectral content. For this reason, a number of attributes of the songs were net appropriate to use for similarity testing. Consider artist name for example. Two songs by the same artist are obviously similar in that attribute, but might be completely different in their harmonic, dynamic and spectral content. As a consequence, attributes such as artist name, song name, release year etc. were deselected for the final data mining process. In other words, the attributes that \textit{were} selected for use in later data mining processes were segments and sections data, in addition to structural and harmonic meta-data attributes such as key-signature, tempo, time-signature and similar.

The sections and segments data were problematic to use for direct comparison.
