\subsection{Parsing Data}
\label{sec:preprocessing_parsing}

HDF5, the fifth iteration of the \emph{hierachical data format}, is only supported by C, with a part of the API available
in C\# wrappers. These wrappers, however, are direct ports of the C API: not very object oriented, and not very easy to use.
\\\\
To parse the data, an object oriented wrapper was created (see Figure \ref{fig:hdf5-syntax}), handling the reading of data in a more accessible manner. HDF5 files
are organized in files, each file containing several groups (like folders in a normal file system). Each group contains
datasets of various types.
\\\\
There are scalar and compound datasets, where a scalar dataset can be seen as a single multi-dimensional point, and compound
datasets are much like those found in relational databases (albeit without the relations): attribute names are used to describe
the different columns; each column has a specific data type; and the dataset can have several rows.
\\\\
\noindent
The HDF5Reader reads to a virtual representation of songs (the Song class), which contains the all the relevant fields for our data
mining.
\\\\
The LRN format is simply a tab-separated format, with the first few lines describing the contents of the file. Writing to this format
is straight-forward. In order to be able to load the data quickly for further data mining, we have created an LRNReader, which reads
the data to Songs.
